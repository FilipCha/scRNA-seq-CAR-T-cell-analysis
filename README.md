# scRNA-seq-CAR-T-cell-analysis
This R markdown code was used for the analysis of scRNA-seq data of PBMC from 3 donors inoculated with VSV-LV, CD8-LV or CD4-LV, transfering CD19-CAR to the respective target cells.

The count matrices and raw sequencing data can be accessed through NCBIâ€™s Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), in the series with the accession number GSE....
Raw sequencing files are deposited in Sequence Read Archive (SRA) under the project number PRJNA950024.
